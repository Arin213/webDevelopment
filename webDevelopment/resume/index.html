        <h1>Summary:</h1>
        <p>I am genuinely curious to learn and have a passion for <b>programming, mathematics, philosophy, and novels.</b> Currently,</br>
            I am on an exploratory journey in the direction of concepts involved in writing <strong>codes, mostly Python and Java, and improving my Japanese language.</strong> <br/>
            Understanding the mechanics and mysteries of the world has always been intriguing to me, and hence quite often, 
            I find myself deeply pondering some philosophical questions.<br/>
            Add to that a quest for personal growth, always with an eye on giving back in some positive way to humanity.<br/>
            An introvert, I derive energy from solitude, but once I break this shell, one can find me quite an extrovert within the closed circles. 
            What remains a vivid part of my personal life is the resilience and dedication with which I have been working through challenges and <b>never stopped growing.</b></p>
